# CipherTool Demo

CipherTool is a simple web-based encryption and decryption tool that allows users to experiment with classic ciphers. The application provides a user-friendly interface to explore how different ciphers work in real-time.

## 🔐 Supported Ciphers

- **Rail-Fence Cipher**
- **Polyalphabetic Cipher** (e.g., Vigenère Cipher)
- **Playfair Cipher**

## 💡 Features

- Tab-based UI to switch between cipher tools.
- Encryption and decryption for all included ciphers.
- Responsive and clean layout using HTML/CSS.
- No frameworks or external libraries required.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
3. Select a cipher tab, enter your text and key (if required), then click "Encrypt" or "Decrypt".

## 🔍 Cipher Overviews

### Rail-Fence Cipher
A transposition cipher that arranges text in a zigzag pattern across a number of rails (rows), then reads each row sequentially.

### Polyalphabetic Cipher
A method of encryption using multiple Caesar ciphers in sequence with a keyword. Commonly implemented as the Vigenère Cipher.

### Playfair Cipher
A digraph substitution cipher using a 5x5 matrix of letters derived from a keyword. Encrypts letter pairs with position-based rules.

## 🛠 Built With
